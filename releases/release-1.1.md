## Enhanced Main Popup

- **Site Filter & Search**: Added a "Site Filter" checkbox to toggle site-specific filtering on or off (enabled by default).
  - You can also use the new search box to quickly find scripts by title, with matching text highlighted for easy identification.
  - When site filtering is turned off, you can be on a non-site page (e.g. chrome plugin or 'new tab' and items will now be visible)
- **Organized Script List**: Visual dividers (`---`) and section headers (titles starting with `#`) help you separate and organize groups of scripts more clearly.

## Improved Script Management in Edit Popup

- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Reorder your scripts intuitively with drag-and-drop functionality, making it simpler to organize scripts just the way you want.

## Redesigned Settings Popup with New "About" Section

- **Tabbed Interface**: Settings are now organized into three tabs:
  - **Import/Export**: Access backup and import options more easily.
  - **Statistics**: Check storage usage and script counts at a glance.
  - **About (New)**: View application details, including version, description, and links to GitHub and the Chrome Web Store for support and updates.

## Streamlined Import Options

- Import / Restore snippets collection from a URL
- Select a script collection URL from the dropdown in the Import section - five sample selections to choose from
- Show version details page on github when plugin is updated

## Github Release Page

- When the plugin is updated, it will show the GitHub release page automatically so you know what's changed.
